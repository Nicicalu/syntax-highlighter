# Syntax Highlighter for Word Documents

Effortlessly highlight and format your code for direct pasting into Word documents.
Simplify your workflow and present your code professionally.

I created this tool, because there were many tools like it and all of them were going offline or stopped working. If you have feedback or problems, please create a GitHub issue.

It's also very simple, small and fits into one HTML file. You can download or clone the repo and host it yourself.
